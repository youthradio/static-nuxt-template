There are so many people around you! Are you criticizing how I raised you? I haven’t done anything wrong. I always listen to you! This conversation is OVER. Go to your room.”\n","result":"Both you and your teen are upset. They don’t take a chance to let you know how they are feeling about things ever again.

Those kinds of scenes are too crowded and noisy for me, and I’m not that interested in it anyway. I need to lay low this weekend. Mommy is just too tired.”\n","result":"Your teen will feel as though you don’t want to spend time with them at all, because you decided not to do anything with them for the weekend.

And then we can go somewhere less crowded, like grab ice cream?”\n","result":"The teen is happy and will enjoy the weekend with you, in part because you both compromised. Your teen will feel that you want to spend time with them and will continue to suggest fun activities for you to do together, because they know they’ll be heard.\n"}]},{"title":"Scenario 7\n","text":"Your teen is talking about their class schedule for the upcoming school year. They’re really confused about why they need to take trigonometry. They think that schools should just get rid of math all together and they should get to choose what they want to learn.\n","options":[{"option":"You interrupt them midway through their explanation and tell them: “The choice shouldn’t be yours because a lot of kids would not be ready to make that decision. It would be chaos!”\n","result":"The teen will want to end the conversation or an unnecessary argument will start, because you didn't let them complete their statement and yelled your opinion at them, rather than hearing them all the way through.\n"},{"option":"You listen to explanation all the way through and relate to their feelings — maybe saying, “I hated math, too!” or “That’s how I felt about French.” And then you go on: “But structure is necessary. It’s good to be exposed to everything because you won’t know what you like until you try it.”\n","result":"The teen will try to understand your point because you fully listened to their viewpoint and showed some understanding of theirs by creating a connection. The young person will continue having conversations like this with you because they know they’ll be heard and can trust that their opinion will be respected.\n"}]}]}}
